This apps is basically for the people who lives in a mess. They can use this for their daily Meal count. Also at last they will get the actual result of their mess. Here in this apps Manager can add/update meal and cost of all member of mess. Also manager can add manager as well as member. But member can only view all the information written by manager. For create this app I use Flutter Framework and dart language and sqflite for live update and use Android Studio software.
